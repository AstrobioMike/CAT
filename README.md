Installation


First, you need to decompress the zip file:

$ unzip CAT.zip

This will generate the folder CAT and inside it the folders bin and documentation

The folder documentation contains the databases with taxonomic information and the third-party programs used by CAT: diamond and prodigal

You need to use diamond to create the nr database by following the instructions here:

 http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/data/software/diamond/download/public/manual.pdf

inside the documentation folder do:

$diamond makedb â€“in nr.faa -d nr

Once you have inside this folder the nr.dmnd  file generated by the previous step, you can run CAT.

You also need to download the NCBI taxonomy files found in: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/



gi_taxid_prot.dmp
names.dmp
nodes.dmp




Running CAT

Go to the folder bin and run:

$python cat.py input_contigs_file N C

N = numeric, the number of threads you want for the diamond search

C= The bit-score cut off (numeric 0.1 - 1)




Output files:

CAT will generate the following output files:


Main files:

A file with the taxonomic classification of the predicted genes:  contigs_prodigal.m8.proteinsclassification.tab

This file contains the following columns:

Contig
Predicted protein
Taxon ID of the taxon to which it was classified
Taxon to which it was classified  (T)
Rank of the classification
The number of proteins within 90% range of the bitscore of the top hit 
Average bitscore of the proteins within 90% range of the bitscore of the top hit (B)
The amino-acid sequence of the protein




And  a file with the classification of the contigs: contigs_prodigal.m8.contigclassification.tab

This file contains the following columns:

Contig
Superkingdom
Phylum
Class
Order
Family
Genus
Species


Intermediate files:

contigs_prodigal.faa
(fasta file containing predicted genes in protein sequence)

contigs_prodigal.fna
(fasta file containing predicted genes in nucleotide)

contigs_prodigal.gff
(file mapping the predicted genes to their contigs)

contigs_prodigal.m8 
(file with diamond blast results)

and other files related to the diamond input.
